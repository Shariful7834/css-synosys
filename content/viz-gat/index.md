We are excited to present the **Global Mobility Visualization**, an interactive tool that provides insights into the worldwide air-transportation network.

This visualization captures data from approximately **4,000 airports** globally, linking them with around **51,000 connections**. Annually, more than **3 billion passengers** navigate this network, covering a **total daily distance of over 15 million kilometers**â€”equivalent to **three times the radius of our solar system** under normal conditions.

By leveraging **interactive network modeling**, this project highlights key aspects of global mobility and connectivity.
