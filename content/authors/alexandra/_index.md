# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: Alexandra (Lexa) joined the junior research group “Computational Social Science” in 2024 as a PhD student. Drawing from a background in cognitive neuroscience and political economy, Lexa adopts an integrative approach to bridge explanatory gaps between individual neurocognitive mechanisms and broader societal dynamics. Previous work at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development on digital behavior, risk literacy, adaptive rationality, and cognitive load further informed this perspective.
